# Social-Network-API

## Description 
This is the eighteenth challenge for the UTA boot camp. This project was created to utilize Express and MongoDB as the database. For this challenge, I was focused on creating HTTP request routes for a social network website where users can operate the CRUD method. 

## Usage 
1. Clone the repository
2. Open up the integrated terminal in your code editor and run the server 
3. Since there is no front-end set, you can run the routes through any client-based applications
